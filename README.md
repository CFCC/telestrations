# Telestrations

This is a web version of the game [Telestrations](https://theop.games/products/game/telestrations-12-player-the-party-pack/).
because it is a web based drawing game, it is best played
on a tablet, touch screen computer, or a computer with a
drawing tablet. It is possible to use a phone, but you
 may be disappointed with your drawing abilities with such 
 a limited canvas.
 
## Running
 
The whole thing can be run in one command:
 
```bash
$ yarn start
```

Beautiful, isn't it?
